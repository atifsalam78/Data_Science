patients:
Messy Data
Contact Column: should be seprated into two columns


Dirty Data
Zip Code should be 5 digits - (Validity)
State Column should be in one form long or short - (Consistency)
Null Vaues in address, city, state, zip code, country, contact - (Competency)
birthdate is in wrong format shoud be date - (Validity)
zipcode, sex is in wrong format - (Consistency)
"John Doe" have duplicated entries - (Accuracy)
patient_id 9 is misspelled it should be "David" instead of "Dsvid" - (Consistency) - Accuracy
patient_id 211 has abnormal weight according to his height - (Accuracy)
patient_id 5 has abnormal height according to his weight - (Accuracy)

treatments & treatments_cut:
Messy Data
Column auralin & novodra have starting and ending values in same column it should be in seprate column
merge both the tables


Dirty Data
Column auralin & novodra have starting and ending values and remove "u" - (Validity)
given_name & surname is in lower case while in patient table is in Capatalize - (Consistency)
Column auralin & novodra both have "-" instead of blank which is actualy null values but pandas will not consider these as null values - (Competency)
patient_id 136 has duplicated entries - (Accuracy)
hba1c_change has null values - (Completion)
hba1c_change has calculation error "9" instead of "4" - (Accuracy)
"joseph day" have duplicated entries - (Accuracy)

adverse_reactions:
Messy Data:
This table shoud not be exists independently

Dirty Data
    given_name & surname is in lower case - (Consistency)
    
    
Define
1.) Replace all missing values with "No Data" - (Solve Completion)
2.) Subtract hba1c_start from hba1c_end to get all the values
3.) In patients table we will use regex to seperate email and phone
4.) Using concat merge treatments & treatments_cut
5.) Using melt() convert auralin & novodra in long format and column name "dosage range"
6.) Use only values that do not have "-" in column "dosage range"
7.) Split column dosage range into two "range_start" & "range_end" using split() and convert to int
8.) Drop dosage_range column.
9.) Merge adverse_reaction into treatments table
10.) convert birthdate into datetime format
11.) Fill patients table null values into "No Data"
12.) Convert "assigned_sex" into category format
13.) Convert "zip_code" to str and using customize function add "0" before 4 digits values.
14.) Remove duplicate values of patients table "John" "Doe".
15.) Replace "State" column values to abbreviated instead of full name.
16.) Replace "Dsvid" wit correct "David"
17.) Replace wrong height value of patient_id 5 by calculating formula "np.sqrt(patients_df["weight"] / patients_df["bmi"])"
18.) Replace wrong weight value of patient_id 211 by calculating formula "Weight (in kg) = (BMI * (Height (in meters))^2)*2.2"
19.) Capatilize "given_name" & "surname" of table treatments
20.) Remove duplicate values of "Joseph" "Day"
