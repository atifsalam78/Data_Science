Univariate Graphs

Categorical Frequency Distribution
if we have categorical column we perform frequecy and Relative frequency, cummulative 
Frequency - Bar Chart
Relative Frequency - Pie Chart
Cummulaive Frequency - Line Chart

Numerical Frequency Distribution
Frequency Distribution Table (based on bins) - Histogram Chart similar to bar chart but main difference categories is stick with each other
Challenge we have to decide the bins size, because changing of bin size change the histogram shape
Shapes of Histogram

1.) Symmetric Histogram
2.) Bimodal Histogram
3.) Left Skew(tail on left, maximum data on right)
4.) Right Skew(tail on right, maximum data on left)
5.) Uniform (when we made 2 bins only)
6.) No-Pattern (when number of bins are increased)

Bi-Variate Graphs
Scenarios

Categorical - Categorical ===> Contingency Table - Cross Tab - Stack Bar Chart / Stacked Chart

Numerical - Categorical ===> 

Options

Compare distributions ===> Bar Chart, aggregate functions(mean, median, min, max etc) instead of count you can make contingency table
